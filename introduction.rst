Automatic Dependent Surveillance â€“ Broadcast (ADS-B) provides a method by which aircraft broadcast periodic position information. Aircraft determination technologies include: GNSS receiver to determine horizontal coordinates; barometric determination of altitude.

Physical layer
--------------

The physical layer relays ADS-B position reports with two link technologies:

+ Universal access transceiver

+ 1090 MHz extended squitter

  - A squitter refers to random pulses, pulse-pairs and other non-solicited messages used in various aviation radio systems. Squitter pulses are used in DME/TACAN air navigation systems, and because of their randomness, appear the same as unsolicited/unsynchronised replies to other interrogating aircraft. A squitter is used to maintain a regular signal from a ground beacon.
  
  - When refering to a Mode S secondary surveillance radar system, 'squitter' describes messages that are unsolicited downlink transmissions from an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) Mode S transponder system. Mode S transponders transmit acquisition squitter (unsolicited downlink transmissions) to permit passive acquisition by interrogators with broad antenna beams. In contrast, an active acquisition system may be hindered by all-call synchronous garble.

Mode S
------

A Mode S signal carries the ADS-B message from an aircraft. An antenna and  A/D converter enabels reception of encoded mode S  messages to a Linux agent. The focus of this guide provides a framework for working with those data.

An explaination of Mode S modulation and demodulation lays beyond the scope of this guide, however a starting place for in-depth Mode S signal resources can be found in this Wikapedia article and its references https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_surveillance_radar#Mode_S.


ADS-B
-----

An ADS-B message is 112 bits long, following is an example:
::

  BIN format:
  10001101010010000100000011010110001000000010110011000011
  01110001110000110010110011100000010101110110000010011000

  HEX format:
  8D4840D6202CC371C32CE0576098
  

This table lists the key bits of a message:

+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| Bit from | Bit to   | Abbr.    | Name                   |
+==========+==========+==========+========================+
| 1        | 5        | DF       | Downlink Format        |
+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| 6        | 8        | CA       | Message Subtype        |
+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| 9        | 32       | ICAO24   | ICAO aircraft address  |
+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| 33       | 88       | DATA     | Data frame             |
+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| 89       | 112      | PC       | Parity check           |
+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+


The type of the message can be identified by checking its Downlink Format (DF), bit 1 to 5. For ADS-B message, we need: DF = 17 (in decimal), or 10001 (in binary),

Within the data frame, another import value is the Type Code. it tells what is inside of the data frame, it is located from bit 33 to 37 (5 bits)

+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
| Bit from | Bit to   | Abbr.    | Name                   |
+==========+==========+==========+========================+
| 33       | 37       | TC       | Type Code              |
+----------+----------+----------+------------------------+


ADS-B message types
-------------------

By looking at the DF and TC we can quickly understand what kind of information is contained in the data frame. The relations are listed as following:

+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| DF  | TC       | Content                         |
+=====+==========+=================================+
| 17  | 1 to 4   | Aircraft identification         |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 5 to  8  | Surface position                |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 9 to 18  | Airborne position (Baro Alt)    |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 19       | Airborne velocities             |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 20 to 22 | Airborne position (GNSS Height) |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 23       | Test message                    |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 24       | Surface system status           |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 25 to 27 | Reserved                        |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 28       | Extended squitter AC status     |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 29       | Target state and status (V.2)   |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 30       | Reserved                        |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+
| 17  | 31       | Aircraft Operation status       |
+-----+----------+---------------------------------+

Note that within different type of the messages, the configurations of the bits in data frame are different. In next chapter, those will be explained in detail.
